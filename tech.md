## Gen AI

### What is GenAI?

GenAI refers to Generative Artificial Intelligence. This is a subset of artificial intelligence focused on creating new content, which can include text, images, music, or even video, that is similar to what humans produce. Here's a brief overview:

* Text Generation: This involves creating human-like text based on patterns learned from vast datasets. Examples include chatbots, text completion in writing tools, and automated content creation for articles or social media.

* Image Generation: Systems like DALL-E or Midjourney can generate new images from textual descriptions, essentially turning words into visual art.

* Music and Audio: AI can compose music, generate sounds, or even mimic voices for synthetic speech.

* Video: More complex, but AI can assist in creating or altering video content, from simple animations to deepfakes.

GenAI uses models like neural networks, particularly those known as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or transformers for language tasks, to learn from existing data and then generate new instances. The key aspect is that these models do not just replicate but create new content with elements that might not exist in the training data.
